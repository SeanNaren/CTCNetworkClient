# CTCSpeechRecognition

Implementation of [Baidu Warp-CTC](https://github.com/baidu-research/warp-ctc) using torch7.
Creates a network based on the [DeepSpeech2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595v1.pdf) architecture using the Torch7 library, trained with the CTC activation function.

## Features
* Train large models with large datasets via online loading using [LMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database) and multi-GPU support.
* Supports variable length batches via masking.
* Implements the AN4 Audio database as an example of how a dataset can implemented.

## Branches

There are currently two branches, Master and AN4Phoneme:
* Master: This branch trains a neural network based on the [AN4 Audio database](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/databases/an4/) of roughly 900 samples. Also included is an evaluation script which calculates the WER using the AN4 test dataset.
This branch is useful for understanding how the CTC Speech System works and is very easy to run after installation. Highly recommended to checkout this branch.
* AN4Phoneme: This branch is experimental and uses phonemes rather than character based predictions. This is fully credited and extended by [CCorfield](https://github.com/CCorfield) and his awesome work in porting to use phonemes.

## TODO
* Code coverage using tests, of highest importance!
* Finish documentation for technical and general.
* Fix multi-GPU support by correctly handling the merging of multiple grads.
* Add correct sequence wise batch norm to the RNN layers.

## Installation/Documentation

Follow Instructions/Documentation found in the wiki [here](https://github.com/SeanNaren/CTCSpeechRecognition/wiki/Installation) to set up and run the code.
